                <h2>Key Tips for Using Gym Machines</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Adjust Each Machine Properly:</strong> Ensure seats, pads, and attachments align with your body size to prevent injury and maximize effectiveness</li>
                    <li><strong>Start with Light Weights:</strong> Practice proper form before increasing resistance. Begin with 10–15 reps at a manageable weight </li>
                    <li><strong>Use Smooth, Controlled Movements:</strong> Avoid jerky or rushed exercises to focus on the target muscles and reduce risk of injury</li>
                    <li><strong>Focus on Form:</strong>  Keep your back straight, avoid locking joints, and engage the intended muscles with each rep</li>
                    <li><strong>Leverage Machine Help:</strong> Assisted pull-up and dip machines are excellent for building strength gradually if bodyweight exercises are challenging</li>
                </ul>
